Yet another non-blocking, pop-up notification library for the web, strictly without jQuery (or any other dependencies).

### Why?
I wanted simple notification JS library at my day-job which can be used to show popup/toast notifications with variety of configurations, and does it with one strict requirement; **NO external dependencies**. I came across several great libraries which allow to show popup notifications but either they depend on jQuery, or they are not so minimal. Not that they are bad, but it is not wise to include a library to accomplish small task, in a huge project with a large codebase, that carries lot of additional weight with it.

### How Notus is different?
Notus is small, it doesn't rely on any external framework or library, its implementation is rather very simple to understand (and tweak). It relies on modern web standards from core logic to the animations.

See the [project homepage](https://kushalpandya.github.io/notus/) for demo.

### Configure
---
Download the tarball and extract it, include `notus.js` and `notus.css` in your page `<head>`.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Awesome Notifications</title>
  ...
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/notus.css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="src/notus.js"></script>
</head>
```

Install latest Notus release using using `npm`.
```bash
npm install -S notus
```

### Use
---

- **Initialize:**
Get instance of Notus using global `notus(config)` which returns reference to `notus` singleton. Configuration map passed during initialization is considered as default and will be used during creating notifications.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  var myNotus = notus();
</script>
```

- **Call:**
Notus provides a single method `send()` which optionally accepts `config` map to provide certain options. Note that this `config` will override any options that you passed during initialization of Notus.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  myNotus.send({
    notusType: 'popup',
    notusPosition: 'top-left',
    title: 'Notus Popup',
    message: 'Hello from Notus!!'
  });
</script>
```
 - **Options:**
Notus supports following options.

	- `notusType`: Type of notification you want to show, it can be `popup` (default), `toast` or `snackbar` (inspired from Android's [Snackbar](http://www.getmdl.io/components/index.html#snackbar-section) notifications).
	- `notusPosition`: Location on viewport where you want to show notification. Popup notification supports `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left` & `bottom-right` positions, while Toast & Snackbar support only `top` & `bottom` positions.
	- `alertType`: Alert type determines whether notification is relating to `success`, `failure`, `warning` or `none` (i.e. Neutral).
	- `title`: Title of notification to be shown, not available for `snackbar`.
	- `message`: Message text to be shown in notification.
	- `closable`: Whether to show close button to close notification.
	- `closeHandler`: Callback method to call when close button is clicked. By default, notification will be dismissed after callback is called and executed, but you can prevent notification from dismissing by returning `true` (or a _truthy_ value) from the callback.
	- `actionable`: Notus supports actions on all notification types (starting `v0.3.0` to perform something when an action is clicked). Notus currently supports only two actions; **primary** & **secondary**. Default value for actionable is `false`. In case this property is set to `true`, you need to provide at least one of the available action types; `primaryAction` and/or `secondaryAction`.
		- `primaryAction`/`secondaryAction`: This is an object containing following properties.
			- `text`: Title of action, it supports markup in case `htmlString` is set to `true`.
			- `actionHandler`: Callback function to invoke when action is clicked by user. By default, notification will be dismissed after callback is called and executed, but you can prevent notification from dismissing by returning `true` (or a _truthy_ value) from the callback.
	- `htmlString`:  By default, Notus prevents value of `title`, `message` and `actionText` to have  HTML markup for safety reasons. Set this to `true` to allow notification texts to support HTML markup.
	- `autoClose`: Whether to close notification automatically after certain duration. Default is `true`.
	- `autoCloseDuration`: Duration (in milliseconds) to wait before automatically closing the notification. Default is `3000`.
	- `animate`: Whether to show/hide notification with animation. Default is `true`.
	- `animationType`: Animation type to use while performing show/hide animation. Supported types are `slide` (default), `fade` and `custom` (only available in >=`v0.2.0`).
	- `animationDuration`: Speed of animation in milliseconds. Default is `300`.
	- `animationFunction`: Value to pass to CSS `animation-timing-function` property. Value can be any valid value that original CSS property supports (including `cubic-bezier()` & `steps()`). Default is `ease-out`. See [MDN article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function) on this CSS property. **Note:** This config is ignored if you provide `animationType` as `custom`.
	- `animationClass`: If you have set `animationType` as `custom`, you can use this config to provide additional animation classes to have complete control on animations. This config is a map which supports following properties.
		- `fixed`: CSS class that you want Notus element to always have (useful in controlling overrides).
		- `entry`: CSS class to use while showing Notus.
		- `exit`: CSS class to use while hiding Notus (only if it auto-closes itself with `autoClose` set to `true`).
	- `themeClass`: CSS class to add to main notification element to apply custom styling. Default is `notus-material-light` which is built-in theme and is part of `notus.css` stylesheet. Note that providing value to this option will replace `notus-material-light` with your value instead of adding a new class.

### Examples
---
- **Popup**: Showing Notus as a popup in bottom-right corner of screen.
```javascript
myNotus.send({
  notusType: 'popup',
  notusPosition: 'bottom-right',
  title: 'Notus Popup',
  message: 'Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas!!'
});
```
- **Calling a method on Close**: Providing `closeHandler` to call custom logic when Notus is closed by user.
```javascript
myNotus.send({
  notusType: 'toast',
  notusPosition: 'bottom',
  title: 'Notus Popup',
  message: 'Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas!!',
  closeHandler: function(e) {
    alert('Close was clicked on Notus');
    return true; // Persist this Toast after click.
  }
});
```
- **Actionable Toast**: Providing `primaryAction` and `secondaryAction` on Toast Notus to call a method on clicking an action.
```javascript
myNotus.send({
  notusType: 'toast',
  notusPosition: 'bottom-right',
  title: 'Notus Popup',
  message: 'Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas!!',
  actionable: true,
  primaryAction: {
    text: 'Confirm',
    actionHandler: function(e) {
      alert('Confirm was clicked!');
      return true; // Persist this Toast after click.
    }
  },
  secondaryAction: {
    text: 'Undo',
    actionHandler: function(e) {
      alert('Undo was clicked!');
    }
  }
});
```
- **Custom Animations**: Providing custom animations using CSS. Starting `v0.2.0`, Notus fully supports custom animations that you define in your own CSS file, along with it, Notus is now also compatible with  [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) to provide custom animations, you're just required to include `animate.css` (download it from project page) into your page as follows to use it (it is not part of notus);
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Awesome Notifications</title>
  ...
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/notus.css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/animate.css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="src/notus.js"></script>
</head>
```
Once included, use `animationType` as `custom` and provide values for `animationClass` as follows.
```javascript
myNotus.send({
  notusType: 'toast',
  notusPosition: 'bottom',
  title: 'Notus Popup',
  message: 'Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas!!',
  animationType: 'custom',
  animationClass: {
    fixed: 'animated', // This is part of animate.css, this class should always be present in element which will animate.
    entry: 'flipInX', // Animation to use when Notus appears, see https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ for more supported animations
    exit: 'flipOutX' // Animation to use when Notus disappears (i.e. auto-closes), see https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ for more supported animations
  }
});
```

### Known Limitations
---

For simplicity in implementation, Notus uses unprefixed versions of CSS properties for animations, so animations will not work on any browser which supports only vendor-prefixed version of CSS properties for `@keyframe` animations. You can work-around this problem by using something like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) against `notus.css` stylesheet while building your project.

### Upgrading from previous release

For those who are upgrading notus to [v0.3.0](https://github.com/kushalpandya/notus/releases/tag/v0.3.0) from previous releases, here are points to keep in mind:

- Support for actions on all notus types (previously limited to only `snackbar`) means `actionHandler` will not work, and you'll need to provide `primaryAction` and/or `secondaryAction` for actions.
- Returning `true` or a _truthy_ value from any handler function (eg; `closeHandler` or `actionHandler` within `primaryAction`/`secondaryAction`) will prevent notus from closing.
